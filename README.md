# ICRC7/ICRC37 Implementation for Internet Computer

This repository contains the first complete and production-ready implementation of the ICRC7/ICRC37 NFT standard for the Internet Computer. This implementation is currently under review by the DFINITY Foundation for community validation.

## Overview

This project provides a complete solution for NFT management on the Internet Computer, consisting of three main components:

**Core NFT Canister**: A full implementation of the ICRC7/ICRC37 standard for NFT management
**Storage Canister**: High-performance storage solution for NFT assets and metadata
**React UI**: Web interface for minting and managing NFTs
**Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability and correctness

## Key Features

- Full ICRC7/ICRC37 standard compliance
- Production-ready implementation
- Complete integration test coverage
- High-performance storage solution
- Transaction history using ICRC3 standard
- Certified HTTP asset serving
- Stable memory storage with heap caching
- Fine-grained access control for assets

## Components

### Core NFT Canister (`src/core_nft`)
The main NFT ledger implementation that handles all NFT operations according to the ICRC7/ICRC37 standard. It uses the ICRC3 standard for transaction history and can work with any storage solution.

### Integration Tests (`integrations_tests`)
A comprehensive test suite that ensures the reliability and correctness of the implementation. The tests cover all aspects of the NFT standard and storage functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Internet Computer SDK (dfx)
- PocketIC for running integration tests
- Rust toolchain

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/nft.git
cd icrc7
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
bash ./scripts/build_all.sh
```

3. Run integration tests:
```bash
export POCKET_IC_BIN=/path/to/pocket-ic
bash ./scripts/run_integrations_tests.sh
```

### Web UI Setup

The project includes a React-based web interface for minting and managing NFTs:

1. **Start local Internet Computer network:**
```bash
dfx start --background --clean
```

2. **Deploy all canisters (including Internet Identity):**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy/local/deploy_all.sh
./scripts/deploy/local/deploy_all.sh
```

3. **Install UI dependencies and start the development server:**
```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm start
```

The UI will be available at http://localhost:3000 and includes:
- üîê Internet Identity authentication
- üé® Interactive NFT metadata creation
- üì§ Image/asset upload to storage
- ü™ô NFT minting with custom metadata
- üìã Personal NFT gallery
- üì± Responsive design

**Note**: The deployment script automatically generates environment variables in `ui/.env.local` with the correct canister IDs.

## Why This Implementation?

This is currently the only complete implementation of the ICRC7/ICRC37 standard that:
- Is fully compliant with the standard
- Has complete integration test coverage
- Is production-ready
- Is under review by DFINITY Foundation
- Uses modern IC features like certified HTTP and stable memory
- Provides a flexible storage solution

## This project also use 

### Storage Canister (`src/storage_canister`)
High-performance storage solution that handles NFT assets and metadata with features like:
- Certified HTTP asset serving
- Stable memory storage with heap caching
- Fine-grained access control
- Efficient asset management

### React UI (`ui`)
Modern web interface for interacting with the NFT canisters:
- Internet Identity integration for authentication
- Interactive forms for NFT metadata creation
- Asset upload and management
- NFT gallery and collection viewing
- Real-time updates and status indicators
